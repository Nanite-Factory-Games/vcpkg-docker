# VCPKG Docker
This repository builds fedora based VCPKH docker images and
pushes them to docker hub.

On amd64 there are prebuilt binaries so this is fast for that image.
For aarch64 however, the binary is not prebuilt, so this takes a while. This build can take up to or more than an hour to finish.
